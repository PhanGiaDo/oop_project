This program illustrating the operation of data structures such as linked list, stack, and queue is a useful exercise for 
gaining a deeper understanding of how these fundamental data structures work and how they are implemented in programming. 
The aims of this program:

+ Understanding the operation and implementation of basic data structures.
+ Improving programming skills and algorithmic thinking.
+ Practical application of data structures in solving programming problems.

=> This program helps you familiarize yourself with and gain a better understanding of basic data structures and 
how to use them effectively in Java.
